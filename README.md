# WalletConnect Android Example

WalletConnect is the web3 standard to connect blockchain wallets to DApps.

The original WalletConnect sample app for Wallets is not clear and not easy to understand, then I created this one to test two features
* Approve/Reject Session Request
* Approve and reject `eth_sign` and `personal_sign`

This app uses MVVM as architecture and Compose to render views.
